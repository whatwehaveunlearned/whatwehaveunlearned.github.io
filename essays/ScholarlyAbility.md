The Destiny-class CyberCANOE is a hybrid-reality environment that provides 20/20 visual acuity in a 13-foot-wide, 320-degree cylindrical structure comprised of tiled passive stereo-capable organic light emitting diode (OLED) displays. Hybrid-reality systems such as Destiny, CAVE2, WAVE and the TourCAVE combine surround-screen virtual reality environments with ultra-high-resolution digital project-rooms. They are intended as collaborative environments that enable multiple users to work minimally encumbered, and hence comfortably, for long periods of time in rooms surrounded by data in the form of visualizations that benefit from being displayed at resolutions matching visual acuity and in stereoscopic 3D. Destiny is unique in that: it is the first hybrid-reality system to use OLED displays; it uses a real-time software-based approach rather than a physical optical approach for minimizing stereoscopic crosstalk when images are viewed severely off-axis on polarized stereoscopic displays; and it used Microsoft’s HoloLens augmented reality display to prototype its design and aid in its construction. This paper will describe Destiny’s design and implementation - in particular the technique for software-based crosstalk mitigation. Lastly it will describe how the HoloLens helped validate Destiny’s design as well as train the construction team in its assembly.
